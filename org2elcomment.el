;; Convert `org-mode' file to Elisp comments.


;; 1 Overview
;; ==========

;;   This simple package is mainly used for Elisp package writers. After
;;   you've written the `README.org' for your package, you can use
;;   `org2elcomment' to convert the org file to Elisp comments in the
;;   corresponding source code file.


;; 2 Usage
;; =======

;;   Make sure your source code file has `;;; Commentary:' and `;;; Code:'
;;   lines. The generated comments will be put between these two lines. If
;;   you use `auto-insert', it will take care of generating a standard file
;;   header that contains these two lines in your source code.

;;   In your Org file, invoke `org2elcomment', select the source code file,
;;   and done! Now take a look at your source code file, you can see your
;;   Org file has been converted to the comments in your source code file.


;; 3 Customization
;; ===============

;;   Behind the scenes, this package uses `org-export-as' function and the
;;   default backend is `ascii'. You can change to whatever backend that
;;   your org-mode export engine supports, such as `md' (for markdown):
;;   ,----
;;   | (setq org2elcomment-backend 'md)
;;   `----

;;; Code:

(require 'org)
(require 'pulse nil t)

(defvar org2elcomment-backend 'ascii)

(defvar org2elcomment-last-source nil)

(make-variable-buffer-local 'org2elcomment-last-source)

(defun org2elcomment--find-bounds (buffer)
  (let (beg end)
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (when (re-search-forward "^;;; Commentary:$" nil t)
          (setq beg (line-beginning-position 2))
          (when (re-search-forward "^;;; Code:$")
            (setq end (line-beginning-position))
            (if (and beg end)
                (cons beg end)
              (error "No \";;; Commentary:\" or \";;; Code:\" found"))))))))
